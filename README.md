# SimpleBOWizard
This script helps with all steps required for simple buffer overflows. I created it when preparing for my OSCP exam.

Not all buffer overflows are created equal. Therefore, this script only covers the most basic ones:
- ESP points to a possible payload location
- EAX points to a possible payload location

Feel free to use and customize the script according to your needs.
